= Librechat RAG API running with non-root user

This is a simple example of how to run the Librechat RAG API with a non-root user.
This could be useful for security reasons or to avoid permission issues when running the API in a container or on a server.
For example you might run a OKD cluster and need a container that runs as a non-root user.
